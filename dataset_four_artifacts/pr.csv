spark,thats side improvement which can dropped not major goal commented fixing problems datastreamwriter isnt purpose introducing datastreamwriterv this rather providing symmetric user experience between batch and streaming with dataframewriterv end users can through running batch query with catalog table writer side whereas streaming query doesnt have something enable this problems described previous comment are simply problems structured streaming let explain end comment might going out topic see dataframewriterv has integrated lots other benefits more fluent logical plan write node etc which should great have datastreamwriterv but think theyre not key part writerv supporting catalog table simply major reason have regarding problems structured streaming kicked incomplete state support continuous mode out from structured streaming but basically concerns about continuous mode itself its rather applying hacks workaround architectural limitation one cares about community and had initiated discussion earlier and has been commented various prs think complete mode should kicked out well mode addresses some limited cases but treated one valid modes which adds much complexity some operations which basically shouldnt supported streaming query are supported under complete mode and vice versa because mode doesnt fit naturally its useful now because spark doesnt support true update mode sink and once spark can support update mode sink content external storage should just equivalent what complete mode provides without having dump all outputs thats just because missing feature queryable state probably can simulate complete mode via having special stateful operator which only works with update mode specific micro batch supporting dsv also major headache lots pattern matchings microbatchexecution are support dsv and even therere workarounds applied dsv remember answer discussion thread that dsv streaming data source not exposed public api which great news but see action plan get rid there something dsv cannot cover functionality which possible dsv ? then why not prioritize address problem ?,yes,ds-03-pr

React,its bit awkward because were thinking might lift root scheduling stuff bottom performwork and all that into renderers least one level higher that way renderers like react native have option using different root scheduler than one used react dom thats why you see this duplication nextflushed thing next thing its artifact separation between renderer and scheduler ones with flush name conceptually belong renderer general flow setstate fires requestwork which adds root root schedule and schedules callback performasyncwork with requestidlecallback performasyncwork calls performwork which loops through list roots and starts working them order priority performworkonroot calls render phase and commit phase separate entry points this way renderer has option defer commit phase until later thats how createbatch works before commit phase would always fire right after render phase there was less control,yes,ds-05-PRC

Kafka,think its wrong copy configuration keys meant producer admin client consumer although its appealing quick hack that gets things work quickly breaks down when things get even slightly more complicated example what someone wants set long request timeout admin client but short one producer ? perhaps user wants test producer timeouts but not worry about topic creation timing out but this impossible with current patch you havent given user any way configure separate from producer already have other tests such roundtripworkload which have both producer and consumer are going use producer config configure both ? make user repeat configurations twice ? neither these options are appealing think its sensible just separate configuration into common client configs producer configs and consumer configs that should allow people set whatever configurations they want and also keep things simple,yes,ds-05-PRC

Kafka,both originally added this debugging but think its super useful keep them otherwise its hard inspect log stdout stderr files there are multiple processors that get bounced its hard tell from single file which statements belong which group generation rolling over files make debugging much easier thus would suggest keep this change and also apply other system test with similar pattern,no,ds-05-PRC

superset,summary add functionality wrap sql lab queries with limit common problem people have that they input query sqllab preview their data before hitting visualize create table and then takes forever run this can pain them and potentially database currently one workaround manually enter limit query editor visualizing which creates datasource and then later removing from base query editing created datasource with this mind additional alternative solution might allow users edit sub query visualize modal before creating their datasource heres way have limit only context sql editor limit only applied wrapper select queries and not saved any persistent database https github com apache incubator superset pull like this idea but not sure every database supports prefetching going with this route have configurable page size https github com apache incubator superset issues,no,ds-03-pr

spark,well think depends what you mean handled correctly use time taskset completes its failures happened long ago when taskset started still count those failures app blacklist later failures can trickle and push over limit otoh this also means that were already close limit failures application when this taskset started then really long running taskset will fail push over limit time latest task set finishes weve expired old failures only get failures from new taskset your taskset time longer than blacklist timeout youre unlikely ever get application level blacklisting clearly this not great but its not that bad after all even were app level blacklisted wed hit still timeout and remove bad resources from blacklist that wed need rediscover future blacklists one main reasons app level blacklist avoid lots failures when tasksets are short you really want application level blacklist which useful across really long tasksets then youve got crank your timeout could change this slightly first updating application level blacklist and then expiring failures past timeout but that behavior seems much less intuitive pretty questionable gain does that make sense ? what you think ?,no,ds-03-pr
