hadoop,think its clearer structure code like rather than trying collapse both exceptions into one throw also should log exception thrown getservicestate failover think you probably want catch all throwables another catch clause what its some bad state and your failover attempt caused crash which would give your ipc indentation think better not abbreviate first and second can you add some javadoc its strange that this test case its more like youre showing that particular user error can cause problem rather than showing something about bug right ? else should test case that fails with ignore explaining why fails maybe ? just confirm manual test you mentioned was done with two nns running cluster ?,yes,ds-01-issue

impala,scenario weve seen play out couple times this impala admin sets memory based admission control but sets default query mem limit this means that admission control will use memory estimates instead mem limit typically admins want some protection from large queries consuming excessive memory but cant dont want set single mem limit because workload unknown unpredictable this configuration has caveats and recommend against but this happens and often works well enough long workload comprised relatively simple queries caveats include there enforcement that query stays within memory estimate this means that query can fail force other queries fail memory estimates are often inaccurate this unavoidable since they depend cardinality estimates which are commonly off even with state art query planners this means that runnable queries may impossible admit without setting mem limit something changes about workload new query added stats are computed data size changes make otherwise innocuous planner change then run into second problem above and one more queries cannot executed rejected query from pool root foo request memory needed greater than pool max mem resources use mem limit query option indicate how much memory required per node total memory needed per node mem limit times number nodes executing query see admission control documentation more information last problem problem this jira intending work around preferred solutions which work most time are configure default query memory limit pool set mem limit query disable memory based admission control and admission control based num queries which simpler and easier understand would however useful have third fallback cases where first two options are difficult impossible apply basic requirement allow administrator configure resource pool such that queries with very high estimates can run probably need enough flexibility that they can run concurrently with other smaller queries big query shouldnt take over whole pool and ideally would also have mem limit applied query that were still protected from runaway memory consumption long term solution this impala this short term workaround that can tide users over until have comprehensive solution,yes,ds-01-issue

chromium,adding permissions all does not seem work expected and seem locked out settings now maybe without trailing slash would work this case still think need easier way where when user installs extension security dialog approves usage flash plugin might one way but rather have pop first time user tries embed flash and they approve then goes away much like password manager with some way reset excluded extensions that will ask again such manual alternative eliminating need flash first place which not really perfect solution since flash excels certain things javascript simply cant its own whether not should able its own mystery should able detect user defined page scale though many decimal places desired way scaling use before when only text changed size this wasnt necessary but now when saying doesnt even necessarily mean one really needs able find out what that new ratio nothing else than sanities sake its either that allow user find position top left corner content pane screen space its actual offset from top left window because innerheight corrupted page scaling and cannot compared with outterheight determine height chrome top chrome any reliable way seems work vista but its still not going reliable method since its theme dependent there should some consistent way either get page scale coordinate transform purposes put mouse cursor screenx data into unscaled pixel space over page area one needs able find top left corner page area screen space and there would problem since pagex data also corrupted browser level scaling simple scale ratio could used scale this data into something useful were available then there wouldnt any need find top left corner webpage screen space but really seems like one other required else user zoomed page combined with capturevisibletab essentially useless without flash because you can never determine what under pointer unless page zoom default and not sure who going have patience allow permissions manually but you cant magnify your already zoomed page then there can useful magnification tool any real integration with existing page zoom aside from flash true document screenx window browserscale property either which would solve flash problem this case these are all things you can normally locate one way another only exception when user happens have their page scaled dont see any good reason why this should break anything,no,ds-01-issue

hadoop,hello this referring directory file ? its directory then always returns mtime this also true dont believe there are currently any plans progress change this behavior expected atomicity semantics implementing directory mtime are more challenging implement against blob store compared traditional file system hdfs new file sub directory gets created under directory then users have expectation that corresponding update mtime parent folder atomic with respect file directory creation operation hdfs can take central lock namenode all metadata manipulations transaction blob store this multiple http operations different blob keys and those multiple operations not execute atomic transaction azure file system does provide mtime directories but does not provide atomicity mtime updates just mention this demonstrate that behavior not always consistent across different file system implementations,no,ds-01-issue

thrift,although this issue closed and considered fixed would like add two cents combination tframedtransport and tsocket have worked with hector cassandra client which using thrift which suffering from large deal overhead least analysis came conclusion that performance regression caused least setup overhead tcp layer setup use binary protocol over framed transport over thrift socket without buffering discovered that two tcp segments are being sent every frame sent one length frame and one frame itself more frame larger than maximum tcp segment can hold with small messages overhead substantial extra bytes headers case ethernet tcp also considering that setup psh flag was raised causing bytes length frame pushed from tcp stack application while data itself its way now this issue alleviated using buffered output stream tsocket however think that this solution causes unnecessary memory overhead cases where framed transport used then data memory twice and data first written into framed transport buffer then written buffered output stream socket and then written tcp stack above goes writing side things reading its system call extra first read length and then separte call read frame from socket not estimate this account big difference throughput course cases where framed transport isnt used buffered and output streams are very useful,yes,ds-01-issue
