spark,spark sql fix aggregation after dropduplicates empty data frames what changes were proposed this pull request ? spark sql supports both global aggregation and grouping aggregation global aggregation always return single row with initial aggregation state output even there are zero input rows spark implements this simply checking number grouping keys and treats aggregation global aggregation has zero grouping keys however this simple principle drops ball following case reason that dropduplicates roughly translated into something equivalent this translation implemented rule spark emptydataframe contains zero columns and zero rows therefore rule makes confusing transformation roughly equivalent following one above transformation confusing because resulting aggregate operator contains grouping keys because emptydataframe contains columns and gets recognized global aggregation result spark sql allocates single row filled initial aggregation state and uses output and returns wrong result fix this issue this tweaks appending literal grouping key list resulting aggregate operator when input plan contains zero output columns this way spark emptydataframe dropduplicates now translated into grouping aggregation roughly depicted which now properly treated grouping aggregation and returns correct answer how was this patch tested ? new unit tests added closes from liufengdb fix duplicate,yes,ds-02-commit
